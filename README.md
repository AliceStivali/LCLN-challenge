## Concept 🌐

The picture n#2, that I chose for this project, is a bright and colorful illustration that depicts a group of rowers. This reminded me of the Impressionists, since they often used to capture these kind of scenes. I decided to create some floating figures, that gently move and rotate and should resemble boats in shape and movements. When clicked, each of them reveals a boat-themed impressionist painting.
